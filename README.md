# Probability Calculator

This project determines the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat. 

While it would be possible to calculate the probability using advanced mathematics, this project calculated the approximate probability by performing a large number of experiments. to estimate an approximate probability. The larger the number of experiments, the more accurate the results will be.
